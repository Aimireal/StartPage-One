StartPage-One
=================
Github Pages hosted aesthetic landing website for new tabs. 
Got the main sites I use as well as other good sites for development work, socialising, content creation and hosting.

Blur and No Blur available too!


There are 30 background split into AM/PM groups that are randomly chosen based on the time of day. 
This is handy! Only I don't give light backgrounds for day and dark for night so it is kind of redundant... Oh well I will sort it later I guess (May 2020: Nah not yet)
